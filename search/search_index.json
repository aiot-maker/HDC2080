Description The HDC2080 is a digital humidity and temperature sensor with following selling points: High accuracy Low power consumption I2C interface Programmable thresholds Data Ready / Interruput pin Powering the module - 3.3V only The integrated circuit has a supply voltage range of 1.6V to 3.6V. The module doesn\u00b4t have a voltage regulator therefore it can only be powered by 3.3V from the Raspberry Pi. Pinout SDC SLA are the I2C pins GND , VCC are the powering pins ADD , this input pin allows to select an alternative I2C bus address for the module. When disconnected or connected to GND the module will appear to the bus with 0x40 address. When this pin is connected to 3.3V the I2c address will be 0x41. INT , this output pin can be used to signal measurement available in the registers or be used to signal temperature or humidity thresholds.","title":"HDC2080"},{"location":"#hdc2080","text":"We use a module from CJMCU manufacturer, which is designed around the Texas Instrument HDC2080 integrated circuit.","title":"HDC2080"},{"location":"#description","text":"The HDC2080 is a digital humidity and temperature sensor with following selling points: High accuracy Low power consumption I2C interface Programmable thresholds Data Ready / Interruput pin","title":"Description"},{"location":"#powering-the-module-33v-only","text":"The integrated circuit has a supply voltage range of 1.6V to 3.6V.
